# Ignite-Current-and-Stalling-Testing

This is the repository for tests involving measurements of force and current with an Adafruit Metro M4. This script should be used in conjunction with the already-built microcontroller circuit with a load cell and circuit sensor. 
Depending on the application, either the StallingCurrentMonitor or ForceMonitor can be used to gather the data, put it into files, and graph the data.
THe ForceFlowGraphing file is used to combine force data with flow plot data created with a flowmeter and graph them on the same plot.
